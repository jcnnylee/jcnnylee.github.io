        <h2 id="missionH">Why?</h2>
        <p id=missionP>AAPI Mental Health Awareness was created to educate Asian and non-Asian folks on the impacts of stigma on AAPI communities.
        <br><br>
        With the Covid-19 pandemic, many people have suffered the effects Covid has created for children, adults, and communities. Especially with the rise of Anti-Asian Hate crimes, this has created mental health issues for many Asian Americans.
        <br><br>
        Through raising awareness with resources, stories, and information, it can help AAPI folks dealing with trauma, depression, and other mental illnesses to find comfort and ways to help themselves. Raising awareness can also help people understand the affects mental illness has on others so that there can be less stigma around how it's percieved.</p>

        <h2 id="stigmaH">Stop the Stigma</h2>

        <p id="stigmaP">Stigma around mental illness has damaged many Asian communities in the United States. There are negative connotations that surround mental illness, some of which are related to: cultural values, shame, and restraint. Many Asian Americans experience mental illness but do not speak out about their experience; thus creating a barrier for those who need access to counseling, services, and more. <br><br>It is significant to raise awareness about these underlying issues so there can be change within the Asian community. The only way to decrease the stigma around mental health is by understanding and confronting it through conversations.</p>

      <!-- Section 2: Awareness -->
      <div id="aware">

        <h2 id="awareH">Mental Health Awareness</h2>
        <p id="awareQ"><a>Why is mental health awareness within the Asian community important?</a></p>
        <p id="awareP">Numerous reports have shown that Asian Americans are the least likely to reach out about their mental health. Mental illness is heavily stigmatized in the Asian community. Asian immigrant parents who come to America for a better life do not believe in mental illness, which lead to conversations about mental health continue to be pushed aside and ignored rather than discussed.<br><br> 
       This causes first-generation children to agonize over their problems alone and without any support. Without a support system, it is detrimental to many adolescent's mental health.</p>
